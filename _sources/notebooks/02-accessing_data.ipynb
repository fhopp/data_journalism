Some APIs that are very frequently used (e.g., the Twitter API) have an own Python *wrapper*, which means that you can do something like `import twitter` and have some user-friendly commands. Also, many APIs require authentication (i.e., sth like a username and a password).\n",

This kind of website is a great place to explore some potential datasets for your projects.  If you explore a bit, you'll see there are a ton of datasets and a ton of APIs, as well as raw JSON files for you to download and work with.  Take this illustration just as a way to use APIs if the raw data is not also available.\n",
