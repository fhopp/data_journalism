# Data Journalism 

_Written by Damian Trilling, Penny Sheets, & Frederic Hopp_

One of the most important recent innovations in journalism is the increasing use of data. Often referred to as data journalism (or data-driven journalism), we see a development of using computational techniques to make use of, for instance, massive sets of documents (e.g., leaks), or government data, provided via APIs or scraped from the web.

In short, the increased availability of digital data, fueled by developments such as the trend towards open governance or the use of online media, has opened new ways for journalists to discover and research interesting and relevant stories. While the use of data in journalism is not new (there are examples of tables and data visualizations in newspapers from a century ago), the amount of data and their digital nature require new skills from journalists. At the same time, audiences are demanding greater transparency from news organizations, and the news cycle is ever-more choked with content, both of which challenge journalists to use data in ways that are creative, compelling, transparent, and innovative.

This course combines theoretical discussion of these developments and practical skills training. Next to reading and discussing relevant literature, students will be introduced to the programming language Python, which is widely used for retrieving data from the web and for analyzing both textual and numerical data. Additional topics include data visualization, how to find stories in large amounts of data, and dealing with messy data.

## Course learning goals

Upon completion of this course, students should...

- be familiar with how data journalism is transforming the field of journalism;

- have knowledge of different techniques used in data journalism, involving the acquisition of data (e.g., through scraping or APIs), their analysis, and their presentation/visualization;

- have a basic understanding of how programming languages can be used to achieve data-journalistic goals;

- be able to apply (at least introductory) data-related techniques in the preparation of an original piece of data journalism.

## Structure of the course

We tackle these learning goals in 3 units of the course: Gathering & Verifying Data (unit I); Analyzing Data (unit II); and Visualizing & Presenting Data (unit III). Each unit finishes with an assignment related to the skills and knowledge within that unit, and which builds toward your final assignment.

Additionally, there is a group project, where groups of students will select one of the many freely available online tutorials related to data journalism, learn from it, and prepare a short lesson & guide for their fellow students. This assignment is designed to maximize our knowledge sharing about this developing field during the course, as well as to familiarize you with the vast resources available to those of you who continue to pursue this sort of journalism in the future. More detailed information about the assignments will be made available in class.

## Attendance & evaluation policies

**NEEDS UPDATE**

Due to the covid-19/coronavirus pandemic, all session will take place online, via Zoom. Links will be made available on Canvas. Further course materials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks are provided at https://github.com/uvacw/datajournalism - they will be updated throughout the course, and we will announce which ones you need to work on. Like most Master’s courses at UvA, attendance in this course is mandatory; we expect you to attend each Zoom session—the Monday plenary sessions, and whichever Wednesday lab session you’re assigned to. If you need to miss a session for any reason, please do your utmost to inform us in advance. Please also make sure to attend the Wednesday session you are registered in; the numbers are balanced to ensure a maximum amount of feedback and attention for each student. If multiple session are missed for any reason, make-up work may be assigned.

Your grade comprises two elements: Individual final data journalism project (70%) Group data journalism tool presentation (30%)

If either of these components scores an insufficient grade (<5.5), it can be re-sit. The re-sit deadlines will be determined in consultation with the relevant students. Re-sit assignments can either be for a maximum of a 6.0 (if the same assignment topic/data/tool is used), or for a maximum of 10.0 (if entirely new topics/data/tools are used).

More about each assignment can be found at the end of this document.
