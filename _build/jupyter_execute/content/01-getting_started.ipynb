This allows you to directly save this notebook to a location on your computer. Alternatively, you can find all of these notebooks on the corresponding [Github](https://github.com/fhopp/data_journalism) page. Github is a very popular platform to share code and it has a central role in open-source software development and in open science. People who want to make their data analyses transparent usually share their code here.\n",

You can either leave the original name - pandas - (by just typing `import pandas`) or shorten that name so you don't have to type it again and again and again.  So one shorthand that is commonly used is `pd` for pandas.  Try importing it now with the following command.  You'll see that no output appears, but you should - if you've run it correctly - end up with a number next to the command line."
